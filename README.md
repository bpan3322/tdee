# Total Daily Expenditure Calculator (TDEE)
Personal project. 
Created a TDEE calculator app that takes in certain health information to calculate your total daily expenditure.

# How does it work?
Input your gender, age, current weight, height, and activity level to calculate the total amount of calories you spend each day just by being alive! After inputting your information, just hit the "Calculate" button at the bottom to see your results. This information can be useful because it can rougly gauge your body's current health condition. This information is especially important to those in the fitness industry if their goals are either to gain weight or lose weight. 

# Technologies used
Integrated Flask, Python, Jinja, CSS and HTML coding languages in order to produce this page.

# Challenges I faced
Since there are so many different inputs that the user needs to give, it sometimes got very confusing keeping everything organized and making sure that I was calculating the right variables. 
Another challenge I also faced was what kind of formula to calculate BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) since there exists so many different approaches. I ended up going with the Harris-Benedict formula as it was the most accurate and popular formula used often in fitness and health today.
